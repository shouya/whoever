# As a Twitter API proxy
This is a Twitter API proxy that provides extendable filter function.

# As Whoever
''Whoever == No matter who.''

In cyber social life, don't you feel that you're losting your
objective judgements due to the identity of people?

We accept more easily if the speaker is someone famous, or we are
there omitting to reply a interesting subject if it froms a stranger.

Did we?

It's because of man kind's nature that we can't easily change it. But
if you have mind about that, try this program.

''Whoever'' proxy all your twitter request, and filter to hide almost
all personal information that makes us impossible to recognize who he
is, or what his impress is before.

Now, no matter who anymore, ever.
