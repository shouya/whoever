# Whoever
__NOTICE:__ I am now going to write a new program that provides
powerful features to filter twitter api requests and responses, with
all of possibilities, including tweet texts, user infos, and so on.

__And this project is going to be deprecated.__ (what a short life.)

Please move on [`Twilter`](https://github.com/shouya/twilter) for that
project.

## As a Twitter API proxy
This is a Twitter API proxy that provides extendable filter functions.

## As Whoever
_Whoever == No matter who._

In cyber social life, don't you feel that you're losting your
objective judgements due to the identities of people?

We accept more easily if the speaker is someone famous, or we are
there omitting to reply a interesting subject if it froms a stranger.

Don't we?

It's because of some kind of human's nature that we can't easily
change it.
But if you have mind about that, try this program.

_Whoever_ proxy all your twitter requests, and filter to hide almost
all personal informations that makes us impossible to recognize who he
is, or what his impression is to you before.

Now, no matter who anymore, ever.
